Sophie has multiple accounts, multiple purchases in multiple locations. 
All of these transactions are linked to 2 devices - Mobile and Laptop - Both have IP address in the same network, purchases are in multiple geographical locations but all within a short timeframe within the same day.

All nodes are linked for all entries in the database.
All other data is normal apart from √Åine spending 2800 EUR in Tesco.
I can add more data if necessary.
